# Ruler Introduction

## What does Ruler do?

Ruler is a golang rules engine to ease the expression of business logic rules. Today's societies run on conditional data. Car insurance companies provide clients with quotes based on pre-existing factors such as age, gender and pre-existing faults among other factors. Ruler will help you express this logic in a structured way while maintaining a comfortable level of performance and scalability that can be leveraged within the cloud.
